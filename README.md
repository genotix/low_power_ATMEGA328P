# low_power_ATMEGA328P
My lowest power sketch for the ATMEGA328P / Arduino Nano v3
About 200 nA @ Deep sleep with interrupt wake

Because it is very well possible to make the Arduino Nano v3 run at low power levels
with some hardware tweaks and a useful pattern I provide this slim sketch supplementary 
to my youtube "tutorial":

I hope this helps you in your low-power journey.

Regards,

Eric
