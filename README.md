# low_power_ATMEGA328P
My lowest power sketch for the ATMEGA328P / Arduino Nano v3 ; about 200 nA @ Deep sleep

Because it is very well possible to make the Arduino Nano v3 run at low power levels 
I provide this slim sketch supplementary to my youtube "tutorial".

I hope this helps you in your low-power journey.
